Sometimes I use a mobility scooter or a wheelchair . I also have dyspraxia . This affects the speed at which I can process written and verbal information . Sometimes I may take longer to read something or to write something down . One of the most helpful things for me is bullet pointed notes regarding things that might be key in the session . Note taking can be a little bit more challenging for me as it requires me to split my attention between listening and writing . can cause some challenges with attention deficit .

2018-11-03,I5DMfH,Male,Asian,54,"Since 2016 I have been learning to accept , manage and perhaps overcome my condition of ME / CFS . I have used simple relaxation and mindfulness techniques , explored breathing and body work through a few introductory courses and gained a great deal of benefit . Slowly becoming more aware of my bodies needs and my spiritual needs . My greatest challenges include feeling isolated , I am best when working with others and creating mutual peer support , and a need for a more structured approach to integrate these changes into my daily life . I am particularly drawn to the focus on health of this course and learning from and sharing with others who have a chronic condition . This course was recommended to me a few years ago by a good friend who has benefited greatly from it . After two years exploring how to bring a greater balance to my life , learning to recognise my bodies needs and spiritual nature I finally feel ready for it . In the payment section below I have ticked concessional rate but have applied for a bursary . I hope I 've done that right ! I have ME / CFS my symptoms present mostly as chronic pain , fatigue , muscle and joint pains and brain fog with a variety of other things as well . I currently manage 4 - 5 active hours per day but know when I am managing it well I can increase those active hours as well as use them in a more nourishing way . I have not experienced acute or debilitating depression . I am aware of the impact my condition can have on my mental health which can include some depression , grief , denial , anger and increasingly a little more acceptance and forgiveness . No , currently I do n't identify as having a chronic pain condition . My ME restricts my physical ability and concentration .

I hope to achieve a good foundational knowledge and understanding of mindfulness practice that I can apply daily in my life . I am particularly keen to learn about how mindfulness can help with physical health conditions , including with regards to pacing , as well as with mental wellbeing that can be impacted by physical health challenges . I have postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome ( POTS ) . I have had the condition for many years and it has had a significant impact on my life , both physically and mentally . The condition causes your heart rate to be much faster than it should be , especially when sitting and standing . For example , at rest my heart rate can be up to 150bpm when simply standing still . The other related symptoms include chest pain , severe fatigue , feeling breathless and brain fog . The condition causes ' crashes ' when these symptoms occur and you just have to lie down . I take mediation to reduce my heart rate but the crashes still occur and the condition continues to have a significant impact on my life , both in terms of work and socially , physically and mentally . I have experienced persistent pain that has lasted for at least the last 3 months .

My mental health has been very well managed for the last five years not requiring medication . However this recent situation has required me to take medication . I have started meditation and found this most useful so believe that the mindfulness course would be of benefit . I have completed a 8 week programme ~ How to solve human problems and am currently doing a meditation course about how to transform your life . Again this is proving to be very useful in helping me manage my responses to stressful situations . Look forward to start the training ! I believe it will help in my job role also .

I was diagnosed when I first moved to university . I had to put university on hold for a year whilst I concentrated on my mental health and wellbeing . I returned to university and completed my course symptom and medication free . My Bipolar Disorder is very well managed and as previously mentioned I have been symptom and medication free for over 5 years . Recent events have meant me requiring hospital support on two occasions . I am now in a much happier place and feel that the mindfulness course would help equip me to deal with future stressful situations in a more productive and effective manner and help to prevent further episodes .

Two years of which were total blackness . I am now fully recovered and aiming to be fully off of anti - depressants within the next couple of months ."
2024-01-19,OMfH,Female,White,42,"I am really excited to be finally joining this course after about ten years of wanting to take a Breathworks course and eventually pursue my dream of becoming an accredited mindfulness teacher through Breathworks . First of all I am taking this course to help me more optimally manage my own health conditions . Second of all I am taking this course to further enhance my current work with the students I support at SOAS University where I have been working on the Student Advice and Wellbeing Team as a Mental Health Mentor . In this role I support my students with the impact of the academics on their mental health and overall wellbeing . The work we do together has a wide ranging focus depending on their particular issues and goals . It ranges from supporting them with study skills- completing their coursework- attending and participating in class , joining societies , and managing LTCs- any Specific Learning Differences as the Neurodiversity Team often refers students with ADHD for me to support , and the Disability Team refers students to me with chronic pain and other physical health conditions . I would love to be able to further my skills teaching as it is an extraordinary and powerful tool to manage wellbeing and such a wide variety of issues . It can support so many issues my students are wanting to work on- being better able at focusing , managing their mood , dealing with perfectionism and procrastination . It has been quite a long time since I have taken any mindfulness courses so this would really boost my confidence in teaching my students these skills . I took a Mindfulness course at the Mindfulness Project near Goodge Street in 2014 and also a Mindfulness course at the Recovery College / Springfield Hospital where I used to work in the IAPT in 2012 . I have also had mindfulness training as part of my therapy in 2012 - 2014 . I later developed a creativity and mindfulness intervention for PND through a grant I was awarded and the impact was amazing . In the first instance my goal is to take this course and benefit personally in managing my health conditions as well as becoming more skilled and confident teaching my students . I would love to become a fully qualified mindfulness teacher eventually and be able to teach mindfulness at work , privately and especially create more initiatives in the arts and health . In 2004 when I was studying for a psychology master 's here in London I developed sciatica which caused me a great deal of pain and had an impact on my mental health . I had issues where it would flare up over the years and I would personally experience how physical pain affected my ability to manage my Bipolar Disorder , working as a Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner and my life overall . In 2012 I developed peripheral neuropathy due to incredibly challenging circumstances and was desperate for any technique to manage the unbearable daily pain . I was signed off sick from work , but right before I signed up for the Recovery College 's Mindfulness course . It was astounding and I absolutely loved mindfulness . It was the only thing that "" worked "" in managing the pain . It also supported me in managing so many other issues and throughout my pregnancy in 2013 with my first child . Mindfulness helped immensely when recovering from PND at that time and later in 2019 after having my second child . In 2019 when I was pregnant with my second child I developed carpal tunnel syndrome which I have had until recently . It helped me manage that pain as well . In 2021 I had emergency back surgery and had a pivotal moment in my life . Due to nerve damage I had foot drop and significant pain . I was told if I did not have emergency surgery I could become paralysed . The mindfulness I learned helped sustained me during one of the bleakest moments in my life . I used a foot brace to help me walk and attended physio and neurophysio regularly as I slowly recovered . I eventually needed to have further surgery that year in order to be able to walk without a foot brace .

Due to that and many restrictions that ad to be provided to my life more than 10 years go I experoienced a lot of emotional pain and there was noone who could help at that time to cope with it . With time I discovered on my own that the acceptance and ability to be with what is is the key and that I may live my life fully still though the conditions are different and I had to give up many of my dreams . Or re - define them . This process still lasts .

Even if I end up not doing the TT I 'm looking forward to attendinf this course and learning more about how to use mindfulness daily for stress . I feel like this is more important than ever as life is throwing a lot of unpredictable and difficult situations at us right now and so maintaining some resilience to be able to draw upon in high stress times will only be beneficial now and in the future . I particularly like the kindness and compassion approach to mindfulness Breathworks uses as this is something I try to incorporate daily and look forward to exploring that more .

2020-10-11,OMfS,Female,White,47,"I have several reasons why I signed up for the course . First , I know and was supporting a Breathworks - Buddhism - Introduction - Retreat in August 2019 in Adhisthana , because I have been in the UK doing the Dharma - Life Course for five month . A few weeks ago I joined in the Breathworks Online Weekend Retreat led by and I was quite surprised how deep this went . Then , I see the Breathworks Mindfulness Training as part of my buddhist practice as I want to develop some fearlessness and see this as a good basis for any spiritual development in general . Also I would like to do the Breathworks - training in Germany next year , also because I see this as a very good translation of the and that it 's very helpful for human beings . Beside Vidyamala I also know a few Breathworks - Teachers and I thought , this specific kind of mindfulness - training for me is what has to be done and to work on . Also after almost two years out of professional work , I hope this course will help me dealing mindfully with new professional advantages that might come up as I hope soon to start my new old job again . Also , I was doing a therapy this year and I hope to bring my insights into my daily life with the help of mindfulness training . In addition , I think that for a long time in my life I had no good sense of my self and that I was kind of dependent on other people ( what they want from me or I think they want from me , etc . ) . As I have started a daily meditation practice more than six years ago , this was very helpful for me coming back to myself and to my own experience . During the last couple of months I was also suffering from some body pain issues and I guess , that the mindfulness program is helpful with that ."

I enjoyed the course ! As a longtime meditator for nearly 20 years , I was curious to learn Breathworks approach to teaching mindfulness as I was thinking about enrolling into a Teacher Training course to deliver in the near future . I , myself , began meditating in response to a number of life events that were happening at the time nearly 20 years ago including health issues . I was introduced to Vipassana which was n't easy initially but did over time support me to develop self awareness , self compassion as well as compassion for others - it is a ' tool ' I use daily in my wellness toolbox , so to speak ! Alongside meditation , I also explored different ways of eating to support my energy such as macrobiotic , high protein , raw foods and vegan until I found the right balance ! I also started exercising daily including running and yoga - altogether these were life changing practices to engage with and changed my approach to life positively ! I still exercise and eat a healthy diet as well as meditate daily - I tend to champion these practices among friends and family because I know how effective meditation can be if we commit to practicing regularly in terms of developing self awareness , managing our emotions , being compassionate to others without appearing weak , all of which supports us in our relationships . After having finished the Stress Reduction Course and gaining some insight into Breathworks style , I was interested to learn more about Breathworks flagship course which is the Health Course , as Suzie had explained to me . I asked , Suzie , if potential students may enrol despite not living with a long term health issue . was helpful to explain that students do sign up who may be considering enrolling into the Teacher Training course in order to gain greater understanding of Breathworks approach to pain management , which comes up in the Teacher Training Programme . So , I was keen to pursue enrolling , to help me further consider Teacher Training with Breathworks ... Having had health issues in the past as I outlined above , I 'm familiar with experiencing ' pain ' as well as ' catastrophising ' thoughts that can ensue when we are managing health issues and hoping to heal but uncertain if we will feel as we used to again , which can bring fear and add stress ! I 've also supported friends and loved ones who have been ill over long periods of time to recoup and who had felt ' stress ' by being unable to manage physically to do things for themselves . As such , I feel I can cope in the course and have insight myself in this area so as to not feel overwhelmed by issues other students may be sharing in class time . Please see my answer above .

At the time I did not realize there was also a course specific to dealing with everyday chronic health challenges . As it has been quite some months since I did the MBSR and my health has become much more of a prevalent daily challenge , I thought it would be very helpful to come back and experience these wonderful teachings again with more focus on managing chronic health and also possible transition to end of life planning . As I now work with health in a more wholistic , natural and herbal based way , I do nt tend to use named conditions as I feel this can create stereo types and assumptions of how people may express a certain set of symptoms . I look at the body as a beautiful complex healing system that gets muddled up by our thoughts , actions and environment , thus contributing to unfavourable symptoms which in modern day medicine , like to classify as a particular disease . However , I feel each body is Unique and expresses challenging symptoms in its own way . I am learning how to manage my complex symptoms uniquely for my constitution and body type . * I will gently share , however , that recently my health has crossed into some liminal spaces where we have been discussing end of life planning which has been extremely profound and also difficult . I may or may not disclose this in our sessions ... I will know if it is the right space to do so :) No , currently I do n't identify as having a chronic pain condition .

2020-08-07,OMfH,Female,White,53,"I have lived with debilitating back pain for 21 years after a failed back surgery . I have tried to cope by many means - blocking , running away from the pain , pushing and pushing , different nerve blocks and many other medical attempts , pain clinic trials , etc . I have never been able to return to work , unfortunately , and have to spend most of my time lying down because of the pain . I have tried mindfulness on my own for some months , and try to find some more peace by being in my body . It is both rewarding and challenging . But I really miss better guidance by a teacher with experience instead of just trying by myself . I also think it will be beneficial to feel part of a larger community , as struggling with this alone is isolating physically as well . I am also very excited about the possible benefits of trying out a proper , well - planned 8 - week course taking us all through the different steps . I reached such a low point last autumn where I collapsed once again and could hardly walk , and have tried hard since then with new physiotherapy , a pain course by McGuire University , but I feel something very important is lacking - a sense of peace , deeper rest despite this painful body , and in glimpses of my own practice with mindfulness I somehow believe this might be possible a bit more . So I really hope that this course might help me achieve this in a very committed way to benefit my understanding and practice so I can move forward a bit more gently .

This enforced many changes in my life and that of my family . I have read "" Mindfulness for health "" and incorporate the practices into my meditation and find this an invaluable tool for life . I have not been able to join in a course with a Breathworks teacher as there arn't any with in an hours drive of home that are doing a course in the next few months . I am attending a chronic pain magement course for 8 weeks run by the NHS , where mindfulness is taught as the core part of the course along with mindful movement . There seems to be a shortsge of Mindfulness for health teachers in this area and I have applied to breathworks to join the course in September . I am hoping to get back to nursing working as a member of a team in the community , teaching on a chronic pain management course using MBPM . The team I am workingwith have indicated there may be aplace for me as they are aiming to recruite enough people for two more teams . I have waited 9 months to gain a place on this course .

2022-02-01,OMfH,Female,White,55,"I want to be able to teach this course and have been accepted on the TTi event starting on 25th April 2022 . Doing an 8 - week course in Mindfulness for Health is a prerequisite for acceptance on the TTi programme . However , I have chosen Mindfulness for Health specifically because it resonates with my own experience in 2014/5 when I had an operation for breast cancer and subsequently had to do 6 months chemo / radio / tamoxifen for 5 years etc . Before I knew that existed I realised that I could dramatically minimise my physical and mental / emotional discomforts caused by the treatments through focusing on my breathing and being present . I told someone about this and they told me about . That year I participated in the Mindfulness Summit online hosted by where was a speaker . Now , I would like to share my own experience via this course that focuses on pain reduction and be able to teach this to others so that I can help others reduce their own levels of discomfort and pain caused by medical treatments / fears around illness and help them to live more mindful lives as a result . As above , I had a lot of discomfort as a result of chemotherapy , radiotherapy and tamoxifen which I reduced dramatically through mindful practice - I started doing mindful practice in daily activities first and then later learnt about the guided meditations and incorporated those slowly too . Since my treatments ended I have struggled with varying degrees of neuropathy , joint pains and fatigue and have been able to manage them very well through Mindfulness practice I have experienced persistent pain that has lasted for at least the last 3 months . I sometimes struggle with stress and aim to manage this effectively through Mindfulness practice"

I have had ME / chronic fatigue syndrome for a number of years , but it got considerably worse just over a year ago and I have been finding it difficult coming to terms with the deterioration in my mobilty and energy levels . Re : the question on chronic pain below - I was n't sure how to answer this . I do experience pain as part of the ME if I overdo things , or sit in an unsupportive chair , but I am usually able to manage this though pacing my activity and limiting where I go , and sleeping when I feel unwell . I have found that I am more aware of my pain and anxiety when doing mindfulness , especially body scans . I think this is because I have quite successfully learned to block it out over the years . No , currently I do n't identify as having a chronic pain condition . I also had some very distressing mental health symptoms linked to the menopause . I was extremely depressed at the beginning of the year and having frequent panic attacks and regular thoughts of being better off dead , although never made any plans or harmed myself .

I have mild fibromyalgia which affects my joints and lower back pain I take lots of pain killers and have done for 10 years . WHAT I WANT TO ACHIEVE I really want to find more relief from my physical pain and ease my mind to be able to cope and stay and clearer minded in order to cope as a carer , BUT also for myself , as I 'm now at a point where I have more time for myself at last , and I 've put my needs and dreams on the back burner for a long time whilst priorities for mum have taken president . I want to come off nearly all the pain killers , using the course to help compliment core strengthening one to one classes I 'm having and physio . I d like to look to the future more positively and feel like I have more energy and a different attitude towards each day . I would also like to combine this course , once complete , with a return to my refresher Animal & Human Healing course which I enjoyed previously for a short while as a business , with the hope to be able to treat the whole person , and/or the animal owner , from a different angle re their health , which always seems to be an issue BEFORE I CAN TREAT THE ANIMAL !

With my present caring role , my lower back pain and mild Fibromialgia has got worse , as has the lower back pain . I have had physio on the neck and lower back , and I have been taking pain killers for nearly 10 years . I have been coming off these slowly over the past 18 months , but its difficult some times with my caring role not to make it worse sometimes . I believe the physical pain in my lower back and joints can be worse when I am upset , stresses , anxious or angry . I m now fully ! ! Apart from that I m great ! I have experienced persistent pain that has lasted for at least the last 3 months . I THINK I m depressed , but not sure , I 'm fed up with being more and more of a procrastinator and feel like I have quite a bit less drive or self motivation than I used to have before my Menopause . I ve always been frightened of failing due to pressure from one of my parents as a child , so I feel my self confidence is quite fragile .
