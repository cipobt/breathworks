2024-01-19,OMfH,2024-01-15,Female,"White (including White British, Irish, Gypsy or Irish Traveller)",15/09/1981,"---, ---","In 2004 when I was studying for a psychology master's here in London I developed sciatica which caused me a great deal of pain and had an impact on my mental health. I had issues where it would flare up over the years and I would personally experience how physical pain affected my ability to manage my Bipolar Disorder, working as a Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner and my life overall.

In 2012 I developed peripheral neuropathy due to incredibly challenging circumstances and was desperate for any technique to manage the unbearable daily pain. I was signed off sick from work, but right before I signed up for the Recovery College's Mindfulness course. It was astounding and I absolutely loved mindfulness. It was the only thing that ""worked"" in managing the pain. It also supported me in managing so many other issues and throughout my pregnancy in 2013 with my first child. Mindfulness helped immensely when recovering from PND at that time and later in 2019 after having my second child. In 2019 when I was pregnant with my second child I developed carpal tunnel syndrome which I have had until recently. It helped me manage that pain as well. In 2021 I had emergency back surgery and had a pivotal moment in my life. Due to nerve damage I had foot drop and significant pain. I was told if I did not have emergency surgery I could become paralysed. The mindfulness I learned helped sustained me during one of the bleakest moments in my life. I used a foot brace to help me walk and attended physio and neurophysio regularly as I slowly recovered. I eventually needed to have further surgery that year in order to be able to walk without a foot brace. The journey was challenging beyond belief but mindfulness gave me so much and sustained me in the hardest times. The impact of my physical health on my mental health was powerful and mindfulness definitely helped me get through with compassion. I am still on that journey.

I also was diagnosed with Irritable Bladder Syndrome following all of this due to the stress of the initial experience when I had to have emergency surgery. So managing multiple LTCs with mindfulness by my side is a blessing. Yes, I have experienced persistent pain that has lasted for at least the last 3 months. Bipolar II diagnosed when I was 19 yrs old during my degree. Mindfulness has empowered me to manage this condition and the effect it has on my mood, my self-esteem, my focus, etc.","I am really excited to be finally joining this course after about ten years of wanting to take a Breathworks course and eventually pursue my dream of becoming an accredited mindfulness teacher through Breathworks.

First of all I am taking this course to help me more optimally manage my own health conditions.

Second of all I am taking this course to further enhance my current work with the students I support at SOAS University where I have been working on the Student Advice and Wellbeing Team as a Mental Health Mentor. In this role I support my students with the impact of the academics on their mental health and overall wellbeing. The work we do together has a wide ranging focus depending on their particular issues and goals. It ranges from supporting them with study skills- completing their coursework- attending and participating in class, joining societies, and managing LTCs- any Specific Learning Differences as the Neurodiversity Team often refers students with ADHD for me to support, and the Disability Team refers students to me with chronic pain and other physical health conditions. I would love to be able to further my skills teaching Mindfulness as it is an extraordinary and powerful tool to manage wellbeing and such a wide variety of issues. It can support so many issues my students are wanting to work on- being better able at focusing, managing their mood, dealing with perfectionism and procrastination. 

It has been quite a long time since I have taken any mindfulness courses so this would really boost my confidence in teaching my students these skills. I took a Mindfulness course at the Mindfulness Project near Goodge Street in 2014 and also a Mindfulness course at the Recovery College/Springfield Hospital where I used to work in the IAPT in 2012. I have also had mindfulness training as part of my therapy in 2012-2014. I later developed a creativity and mindfulness intervention for PND through a grant I was awarded and the impact was amazing. 

In the first instance my goal is to take this course and benefit personally in managing my health conditions as well as becoming more skilled and confident teaching my students. I would love to become a fully qualified mindfulness teacher eventually and be able to teach mindfulness at work, privately and especially create more initiatives in the arts and health.

No, currently I don't identify as having a chronic pain condition. Not applicable.","I had been keen to attend the Health Course  after having attended the online 8 week Stress Reduction Course last year, which was delivered by Soo Strong. I enjoyed the course!  As a longtime meditator for nearly 20 years, I was curious to learn Breathworks approach to teaching mindfulness as I was thinking about enrolling into a Teacher Training course to deliver Mindfulness Training in the near future.

I, myself,  began meditating in response to a number of life events that were happening at the time nearly 20 years ago including health issues. I was introduced to Vipassana  which wasn't easy initially but did over time  support me to develop self awareness, self compassion as well as compassion for others - it is a 'tool' I use daily in my wellness toolbox, so to speak! Alongside meditation, I also explored different ways of eating to support my energy such as macrobiotic, high protein, raw foods and vegan until I found the right balance! I also started exercising daily including running and yoga - altogether these were life changing practices to engage with and changed my approach to life positively! I still exercise and eat a healthy diet as well as meditate daily - I tend to champion these practices among friends and family because I know how effective meditation can be if we commit to practicing regularly in terms of developing self awareness, managing our emotions, being compassionate to others without appearing weak, all of which supports us in our relationships.

After having finished the Stress Reduction Course and gaining some insight into Breathworks style, I was interested to learn more about Breathworks flagship course which is the Health Course, as Suzie had explained to me.

I asked, Suzie, if potential students may enrol despite not living with a long term health issue. Suzie was helpful to explain that students do sign up who may be considering enrolling into the Teacher Training course in order to gain greater understanding of Breathworks approach to pain management, which comes up in the Teacher Training Programme. So, I was keen to pursue enrolling, to help me further consider Teacher Training with Breathworks... 

Having had health issues in the past as I outlined above, I'm familiar with experiencing 'pain' as well as 'catastrophising' thoughts that can ensue when we are managing health issues and hoping to heal but uncertain if we will feel as we used to again, which can bring fear and add stress!

I've also supported friends and loved ones who have been ill over long periods of time to recoup and who had felt 'stress'  by being unable to manage physically to do things for themselves.

As such, I feel I can cope in the course and have insight myself in this area so as to not feel overwhelmed by issues other students may be sharing in class time.","Yes, I'm a long time meditator and practice daily currently, as per my first answer above.",Internet search,"Ongoing support communications sign up, I would like to receive updates from Breathworks, Signed up to the newsletter

That affects my arms from elbows to fingers, my torso from neck to tailbone, and the soles of my feet. More recently I have picked up arthritis in both hips which is more acutely painful. Now I walk with a crutch because my left leg is unreliable. In a nutshell, there is pain of some sort in most of my body. My stamina is low. I get about 4 ""good"" hours per day. I also seem to have a circadian rhythm problem, but I am struggling to get the consultant referral that I need under the NHS.

Finally, I have read 2 books by Vidyamala Burch on mindfulness, and I catch the Tuesday evening meditation she does via Zoom and YouTube whenever I can. Yes, I have experienced persistent pain that has lasted for at least the last 3 months. I have experienced depression, and anxiety, especially in relation to my RSIs. I haven't taken an antidepressant since February 2017 and stopping taking them was one of my best decisions. I experience what you might call low mood on a daily basis, but I regard that as the response of a healthy person who is in pain all the time. It's going to get you down! So I don't take pills for that any more, although I wouldn't rule it out if things outside of my control became too much for me to bear without some chemical support. I've had a good bit of CBT and may come to the top of the list for my next course of it during this 8 week course. It depends on how long the list is. 

I find Stoic philosophy, Mindful Self-Compassion and what I am picking up about Buddhism to be far more effective than pills for me.","I have been through two NHS pain management courses, and completed an 8-week Mindful Self-Compassion course (taught by Colette Power, who works with Breathworks), which was prompted by the first Covid lockdown when I discovered MSC. I knew from the first session of MSC that I could improve my pain management using this tool if I learned to use it better. I have wanted to do this course for around 2 years now, but didn't have the money even for the concessionary rate until now. So what I hope to achieve is to deepen and expand my meditation practice.","I am, and I will welcome the fact that it's a requirement because I do skimp on the practice without a goal to aim for. This is another reason that a course like this will be great to remotivate me.

I will make sure to commit at least 20 minutes daily to this practice at least for the duration of the course. It is something I look forward to immensely.",One of Vidyamala's books!,"Ongoing support communications sign up, I would like to receive updates from Breathworks, Signed up to the newsletter

The constant vigilance of monitoring everything I consume and produce, what type of pain, where it's coming from, and where it is, how focused I can be during the day, and telling doctors all of this in a clear and brief way often leads to increased stress and OCD-like symptoms.","Hi, I'm Sam and I'm happy to be joining this class! I have an extensive medical history and a lot of experience with chronic pains, illness, and disease. Throughout the last decade I have seen numerous doctors and received several life-altering diagnoses. It often feels like every doctors appointment leads to some sort of new diagnosis and followup tests. I have been trying to practice mindfulness to help become more compassionate and patient with my body and trying my best not to blame myself for these ongoing medical issues, but it can often feel like I'm in an endless cycle of treating one thing and finding another. I am hoping that through continuing mindfulness practices and this course, I can start seeing more possibilities in life than limitations. I am hoping to feel less consumed by what my body needs to help maintain it. I am hoping to start living more freely again and to start defining myself by other things than my medical conditions.",Yes :),Therapist/Social Worker,

I had surgery on lower back in 2019 to relieve a pinched nerve causing me ciatica in my right leg and a none malignant cyst was removed from my sacram, pelvis and hip bone area of my lower back, both causing me allot of pain.   

I have ware and tear in the lower back area from my farming and live in housekeeping days, and I hold allot of tension and pain it seems, in my shoulders and neck area, especially in the last 3 years or so! 

With my present caring role, my lower back pain and mild Fibromialgia has got worse, as has the lower back pain.

I have had physio on the neck and lower back, and I have been taking pain killers for nearly 10 years.

I have been coming off these slowly over the past 18 months, but its difficult some times with my caring role not to make it worse sometimes.  I believe the physical pain in my lower back and joints can be worse when I am upset, stresses, anxious or angry.

Im now fully Menopausal!!  Apart from that Im great! Yes, I have experienced persistent pain that has lasted for at least the last 3 months. I THINK Im depressed, but not sure, I'm fed up with being more and more of a procrastinator and feel like I have quite a bit less drive or self motivation than I used to have before my Menopause. 

Ive always been frightened of failing due to pressure from one of my parents as a child, so I feel my self confidence is quite fragile.

I'm not as tolerant as I used to be, I'm more assertivenes, but I do get angry allot  more now, especially since being a carer.  Ive gone out in the car before now and just sat and screamed for 10 minutes due to constant demands on me.","I have been a full time live in Carer for my mum since 2020.  She has Alzheimers, and it can be very mentally, emotionally and physically challenging for me.

I have mild fibromyalgia which affects my joints and lower back pain 

I take lots of pain killers and have done for 10 years.

WHAT I WANT TO ACHIEVE

I really want to find more relief from my physical pain and ease my mind to be able to cope and stay calmer and clearer minded in order to cope as a carer, BUT 
also for myself, as I'm now at a point where I have more time for myself at last, and I've put my needs and dreams on the back burner for a long time whilst priorities for mum have taken president.

I want to come off nearly all the pain killers, using the Mindfulness course to help compliment core strengthening one to one classes I'm having and physio.

Id like to look to the future more positively and feel like I have more energy and a different attitude towards each day.

I would also like to combine this course, once complete, with a return to my refresher Animal & Human Healing course which I enjoyed previously for a short while as a business, with the hope to be able to treat the whole person, and/or the animal owner, from a different angle re their health, which always seems to be an issue BEFORE I CAN TREAT THE ANIMAL! ","I'm not able to spend 20 mins every day, but I do spend 5 mins a day am and at night and occasionally go for a walk, but I know this is not enough to make a real difference to my pain, so I've recently made a daily schedule for myself, which I'm trying to keep to.  

I feel that the Mindfulness would def help me manage my time better, its just getting to the point of honouring the time.","I was given a book on Mindfulness by one of my clients, as a Live In Housekeeper.","Signed up to the newsletter

Although in the past i worked in this field, my own health went down through much trauma and have since struggled further mentally.

I will be more likely to be in a difference address come the course, and more grounded again, as through unfortunate circumstance have had to move many many times recently, that’s been taking its toll somewhat.

My own journey with acute, then chronic sciatica brought me to a very subtle place in my practice which basically followed the waves of breath in my body. It has been the gift that put my yoga journey in perspective and allowed me to teach from a deeper, more compassionate place. It was actually one of my students who sent me your book, as a gift, as she felt it was a reflection of what I'd been learning on my mat. She's right! And I have been enjoying the guided meditations for the last couple of months and I have just recently also signed up for the newsletters.

I am a Social Worker by profession and have for some time managed a large service of Social Workers, Psychotherapists and Educational Psychologists across 6 local authorities in 67 Catholic schools in Yorkshire.
For that last year I have been developing and delivering a mindfulness in schools programme which has seen tremendous success. This project has lead me further into developing my own mindfulness practice both on a practical level and in terms of research. I have trained with Mindful School, firstly the 8 week Fundamentals Programme followed by the 8 week  Mindful Educators Programme in order for me to teach in schools I am now exploring the potential to take my knowledge and interest further with teacher training in relation to adults to look at developing support for the adults we work within our charity.
 I have looked at the Teacher Training and felt it very much has the components that I am looking for. In addition to this I also have  a long term long condition myself, I was diagnosed in 2014 with a rare autoimmune disease this course will also help me on a personal level.

Since then, I've attended various meditation groups and meetings and established my own practice. I've started mindfulness meditation more than a year ago and it's been with me since then.

After attending in MBSR and Mindfuln Self ZCompasion Courses I become sure that this is what I would like to work with by giving others the opportuninty to know those methods and skills. 

This course is a step to become a teacher. I am very curious of the way Breathworks works and would like to feel it on my own skin, in my own life. I do not cope with physical pain so much but everyday I cpe with the illness which cannot be cured and influences my life a lot. Due to that and many restrictions that ad to be provided to my life more than 10 years go I experoienced a lot of emotional pain and there was noone who could help at that time to cope with it. With time I discovered on my own that the acceptance and ability to be with what is is the key and that I may live my life fully still though the conditions are different and I had to give up many of my dreams. Or re-define them. This process still lasts. I found out that meditation helps my in accepting both external and internal conditions that are just a part of my life and sometimes cannot be changed. I am willing to learn new methods and checking them as well as providing them to the others in the future. And that is my motivation to attend the course.",,Friend/family/colleague,

After attending in MBSR course and becoming familliar with minfdul - self -copmassion I assured that this is what I would like to do in my life too - to create the opportunity for others to learn those skills and practices (besides that I am a psychologist and see it as a valuable connection). My motivation to take part in this course is to get familliar with the Breathworks  and to experience it ion my own skin. In my life I have to cope with the disease ora condition of health that doesn't cause a physical pain but is incurable. It has become a part of my being and for the last ten years I had to live with it accepting may restrictions that must had been provided to protect my health. The emotional pain I experienced at the beggining of that was incredible. On my own I learnt that only acceptance of that can make me free and live more fully despite my illness. I did a lot of work I guess but I am sure it's a constant process and, in that, mindfulness and meditation turned out to be very helpful. I am curious of Breathworks methods. I would love to know and experience it. And I am decided to become a teacher certified by Breathowrks too. For that this course is just a part of this path.",,Event,
