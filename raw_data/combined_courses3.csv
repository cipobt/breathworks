I have been continuously working on myself for a few years now. I did suffer from severe anxiety in 2010-2012, which I have recovered from greatly. But I
do admit I suffer from acute anxiety from time to time.","The main purpose for me in doing this course is to go on further to do the Teaching Training courses with Breathworks. I also feel like I would benefit greatly from a personal MBSR course, learning of various practices and tools to help me in my own daily life. Also it
would be very beneficial to learn and experience how breathworks teaches MBSR for when i hopefully become a mindfulness practitioner in the future. I am very keen on learning more about mindfulness, about being aware and knowing what to do when stressful situations and emotions do arise. What I would learn from this would be very beneficial not only to my own life but to the lives of others. I have read a lot of Pema Chodrons books, and various other Buddhist and non Buddhists texts. I am a practising Buddhist, I belong to an organisation called the SGI an international lay Buddhist movement. I have been practising since 2010, part of our practice is
chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo and we practice the Lotus Sutra. We attend regular study lectures, and host meetings on a regular basis in our own homes. I do also
meditate quite often daily/hourly! as I find both really helpful. I just feel like at this time in my life, it would be really helpful to have some practical tools of mindfulness
and to see how you approach this. I am facing some challenges in my life, and just need more tools how to deal with challenging emotions and anxiety, also dealing
with internal blocks that I keep facing within me. I have and do benefit from my own Buddhist practice, but I know its always important to keep learning and trying
different techniques to connect to our own inner peace.

I trained as a Drama therapist 5 years ago and work with young people with mental health difficulties in school and community settings.

I think now that I would be good for me to remain mindful of continuing to maintain good mental health and have been learning about mindfulness through online research, taking part i sessions through youtube and hearing about friends experiences.

I returned to university and completed my course symptom and medication free. My Bipolar Disorder is very well managed and as previously mentioned I have been symptom and medication free for over 5 years. Recent events have meant me requiring hospital support on two occasions. I am now in a much happier place and feel that the mindfulness course would help equip me to deal with future stressful situations in a more productive and effective manner and help to prevent further episodes. ,Last year I had to take time off work on two occasions due to a stressful breakdown in a relationship resulting in divorce. I also suffer with Bipolar Disorder and the stress of the situation and my husbands infidelity brought on two episodes. My mental health has been very well managed for the last five years not requiring medication. However this recent situation has required me to take medication. I have started meditation and found this most useful so believe that the mindfulness course would be of benefit. I have completed a 8 week programme ~ How to solve human problems and am currently doing a meditation course about how to transform your life.

Also my fatigue does sometimes get the better of me and I may need to rest. I feel I may still be able to participate while resting as I manage this in yoga often.

I had issues where it would flare up over the years and I would personally experience how physical pain affected my ability to manage my Bipolar Disorder, working as a Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner and my life overall.

In 2012 I developed peripheral neuropathy due to incredibly challenging circumstances and was desperate for any technique to manage the unbearable daily pain. I was signed off sick from work, but right before I signed up for the Recovery College's Mindfulness course. It was astounding and I absolutely loved mindfulness. It was the only thing that ""worked"" in managing the pain. It also supported me in managing so many other issues and throughout my pregnancy in 2013 with my first child. Mindfulness helped immensely when recovering from PND at that time and later in 2019 after having my second child. In 2019 when I was pregnant with my second child I developed carpal tunnel syndrome which I have had until recently. It helped me manage that pain as well. In 2021 I had emergency back surgery and had a pivotal moment in my life. Due to nerve damage I had foot drop and significant pain. I was told if I did not have emergency surgery I could become paralysed. The mindfulness I learned helped sustained me during one of the bleakest moments in my life. I used a foot brace to help me walk and attended physio and neurophysio regularly as I slowly recovered. I eventually needed to have further surgery that year in order to be able to walk without a foot brace. The journey was challenging beyond belief but mindfulness gave me so much and sustained me in the hardest times. The impact of my physical health on my mental health was powerful and mindfulness definitely helped me get through with compassion. I am still on that journey.

I also was diagnosed with Irritable Bladder Syndrome following all of this due to the stress of the initial experience when I had to have emergency surgery. So managing multiple LTCs with mindfulness by my side is a blessing. Yes, I have experienced persistent pain that has lasted for at least the last 3 months.

In this role I support my students with the impact of the academics on their mental health and overall wellbeing. The work we do together has a wide ranging focus depending on their particular issues and goals. It ranges from supporting them with study skills- completing their coursework- attending and participating in class, joining societies, and managing LTCs- any Specific Learning Differences as the Neurodiversity Team often refers students with ADHD for me to support, and the Disability Team refers students to me with chronic pain and other physical health conditions. I would love to be able to further my skills teaching Mindfulness as it is an extraordinary and powerful tool to manage wellbeing and such a wide variety of issues. It can support so many issues my students are wanting to work on- being better able at focusing, managing their mood, dealing with perfectionism and procrastination. 

It has been quite a long time since I have taken any mindfulness courses so this would really boost my confidence in teaching my students these skills. I took a Mindfulness course at the Mindfulness Project near Goodge Street in 2014 and also a Mindfulness course at the Recovery College/Springfield Hospital where I used to work in the IAPT in 2012. I have also had mindfulness training as part of my therapy in 2012-2014. I later developed a creativity and mindfulness intervention for PND through a grant I was awarded and the impact was amazing. 

In the first instance my goal is to take this course and benefit personally in managing my health conditions as well as becoming more skilled and confident teaching my students. I would love to become a fully qualified mindfulness teacher eventually and be able to teach mindfulness at work, privately and especially create more initiatives in the arts and health.

No, currently I don't identify as having a chronic pain condition. Not applicable.","I had been keen to attend the Health Course  after having attended the online 8 week Stress Reduction Course last year, which was delivered by Soo Strong. I enjoyed the course!  As a longtime meditator for nearly 20 years, I was curious to learn Breathworks approach to teaching mindfulness as I was thinking about enrolling into a Teacher Training course to deliver Mindfulness Training in the near future.

I, myself,  began meditating in response to a number of life events that were happening at the time nearly 20 years ago including health issues. I was introduced to Vipassana  which wasn't easy initially but did over time  support me to develop self awareness, self compassion as well as compassion for others - it is a 'tool' I use daily in my wellness toolbox, so to speak! Alongside meditation, I also explored different ways of eating to support my energy such as macrobiotic, high protein, raw foods and vegan until I found the right balance! I also started exercising daily including running and yoga - altogether these were life changing practices to engage with and changed my approach to life positively! I still exercise and eat a healthy diet as well as meditate daily - I tend to champion these practices among friends and family because I know how effective meditation can be if we commit to practicing regularly in terms of developing self awareness, managing our emotions, being compassionate to others without appearing weak, all of which supports us in our relationships.

After having finished the Stress Reduction Course and gaining some insight into Breathworks style, I was interested to learn more about Breathworks flagship course which is the Health Course, as Suzie had explained to me.

I asked, Suzie, if potential students may enrol despite not living with a long term health issue. Suzie was helpful to explain that students do sign up who may be considering enrolling into the Teacher Training course in order to gain greater understanding of Breathworks approach to pain management, which comes up in the Teacher Training Programme. So, I was keen to pursue enrolling, to help me further consider Teacher Training with Breathworks... 

Having had health issues in the past as I outlined above, I'm familiar with experiencing 'pain' as well as 'catastrophising' thoughts that can ensue when we are managing health issues and hoping to heal but uncertain if we will feel as we used to again, which can bring fear and add stress!

I've also supported friends and loved ones who have been ill over long periods of time to recoup and who had felt 'stress'  by being unable to manage physically to do things for themselves.

As such, I feel I can cope in the course and have insight myself in this area so as to not feel overwhelmed by issues other students may be sharing in class time.","Yes, I'm a long time meditator and practice daily currently, as per my first answer above.",Internet search

That affects my arms from elbows to fingers, my torso from neck to tailbone, and the soles of my feet. More recently I have picked up arthritis in both hips which is more acutely painful. Now I walk with a crutch because my left leg is unreliable. In a nutshell, there is pain of some sort in most of my body. My stamina is low. I get about 4 ""good"" hours per day. I also seem to have a circadian rhythm problem, but I am struggling to get the consultant referral that I need under the NHS.

Finally, I have read 2 books by Vidyamala Burch on mindfulness, and I catch the Tuesday evening meditation she does via Zoom and YouTube whenever I can. Yes, I have experienced persistent pain that has lasted for at least the last 3 months. I have experienced depression, and anxiety, especially in relation to my RSIs. I haven't taken an antidepressant since February 2017 and stopping taking them was one of my best decisions. I experience what you might call low mood on a daily basis, but I regard that as the response of a healthy person who is in pain all the time. It's going to get you down! So I don't take pills for that any more, although I wouldn't rule it out if things outside of my control became too much for me to bear without some chemical support. I've had a good bit of CBT and may come to the top of the list for my next course of it during this 8 week course. It depends on how long the list is. 

I find Stoic philosophy, Mindful Self-Compassion and what I am picking up about Buddhism to be far more effective than pills for me.","I have been through two NHS pain management courses, and completed an 8-week Mindful Self-Compassion course (taught by Colette Power, who works with Breathworks), which was prompted by the first Covid lockdown when I discovered MSC. I knew from the first session of MSC that I could improve my pain management using this tool if I learned to use it better. I have wanted to do this course for around 2 years now, but didn't have the money even for the concessionary rate until now. So what I hope to achieve is to deepen and expand my meditation practice.","I am, and I will welcome the fact that it's a requirement because I do skimp on the practice without a goal to aim for.

I had surgery on lower back in 2019 to relieve a pinched nerve causing me ciatica in my right leg and a none malignant cyst was removed from my sacram, pelvis and hip bone area of my lower back, both causing me allot of pain.   

I have ware and tear in the lower back area from my farming and live in housekeeping days, and I hold allot of tension and pain it seems, in my shoulders and neck area, especially in the last 3 years or so! 

With my present caring role, my lower back pain and mild Fibromialgia has got worse, as has the lower back pain.

I have had physio on the neck and lower back, and I have been taking pain killers for nearly 10 years.

I have been coming off these slowly over the past 18 months, but its difficult some times with my caring role not to make it worse sometimes.  I believe the physical pain in my lower back and joints can be worse when I am upset, stresses, anxious or angry.

Im now fully Menopausal!!  Apart from that Im great! Yes, I have experienced persistent pain that has lasted for at least the last 3 months. I THINK Im depressed, but not sure, I'm fed up with being more and more of a procrastinator and feel like I have quite a bit less drive or self motivation than I used to have before my Menopause. 

Ive always been frightened of failing due to pressure from one of my parents as a child, so I feel my self confidence is quite fragile.

I'm not as tolerant as I used to be, I'm more assertivenes, but I do get angry allot  more now, especially since being a carer.  Ive gone out in the car before now and just sat and screamed for 10 minutes due to constant demands on me.","I have been a full time live in Carer for my mum since 2020.  She has Alzheimers, and it can be very mentally, emotionally and physically challenging for me.  I'm hoping this course can help me cope better with all three areas, I face daily with my situation and mum whilst caring for her.

I have mild fibromyalgia which affects my joints and lower back pain 

I take lots of pain killers and have done for 10 years.

WHAT I WANT TO ACHIEVE

I really want to find more relief from my physical pain and ease my mind to be able to cope and stay calmer and clearer minded in order to cope as a carer, BUT 
also for myself, as I'm now at a point where I have more time for myself at last, and I've put my needs and dreams on the back burner for a long time whilst priorities for mum have taken president.

I want to come off nearly all the pain killers, using the Mindfulness course to help compliment core strengthening one to one classes I'm having and physio.

Id like to look to the future more positively and feel like I have more energy and a different attitude towards each day.

I would also like to combine this course, once complete, with a return to my refresher Animal & Human Healing course which I enjoyed previously for a short while as a business, with the hope to be able to treat the whole person, and/or the animal owner, from a different angle re their health, which always seems to be an issue BEFORE I CAN TREAT THE ANIMAL! ","I'm not able to spend 20 mins every day, but I do spend 5 mins a day am and at night and occasionally go for a walk, but I know this is not enough to make a real difference to my pain, so I've recently made a daily schedule for myself, which I'm trying to keep to.  

I feel that the Mindfulness would def help me manage my time better, its just getting to the point of honouring the time.","I was given a book on Mindfulness by one of my clients, as a Live In Housekeeper."

I have tried to cope by many means - blocking, running away from the pain, pushing and pushing, different nerve blocks and many other medical attempts, pain clinic trials, etc. I have never been able to return to work, unfortunately, and have to spend most of my time lying down because of the pain.
I have tried mindfulness on my own for some months, and try to find some more peace by being in my body. It is both rewarding and challenging. But I really miss better guidance by a teacher with experience instead of just trying by myself.

I am also very excited about the possible benefits of trying out a proper, well-planned 8-week course taking us all through the different steps. I reached such a low point last autumn where I collapsed once again and could hardly walk, and have tried hard since then with new physiotherapy, a pain  course by McGuire University, but I feel something very important is lacking - a sense of peace, deeper rest despite this painful body, and in glimpses of my own practice with mindfulness I somehow believe this might be possible a bit more.

About three years ago the pain became extreme and unrelenting. It is only now beginning to settle after a very difficult surgery ( my third) about 11 months ago.
It’s taken a long time to recover from this one (the other two I was much younger; I’m 52 now), and I want to cope better with ongoing pain and mobility limitations as I do a graduated return to work beginning in January. I’ve realized that the coping mechanism I learned as a child was to push through pain, continue with my life, not miss out on anything. It turns out that meant a lot of disassociation that prevented me from truly taking care of myself. I’m very excited for this course. It seems like it was meant for me because it was started by a woman who had back pain and surgery as a young person, just like me.

I loved reading Joy's story which is why I want to join her course even though I am 10 days late.  I am on week 5 of the book and think I will find it much more helpful if I was working with other people at the same time.

I am a Social Worker by profession and have for some time managed a large service of Social Workers, Psychotherapists and Educational Psychologists across 6 local authorities in 67 Catholic schools in Yorkshire.
For that last year I have been developing and delivering a mindfulness in schools programme which has seen tremendous success. This project has lead me further into developing my own mindfulness practice both on a practical level and in terms of research. I have trained with Mindful School, firstly the 8 week Fundamentals Programme followed by the 8 week  Mindful Educators Programme in order for me to teach in schools I am now exploring the potential to take my knowledge and interest further with teacher training in relation to adults to look at developing support for the adults we work within our charity.
 I have looked at the Teacher Training and felt it very much has the components that I am looking for. In addition to this I also have  a long term long condition myself, I was diagnosed in 2014 with a rare autoimmune disease this course will also help me on a personal level.

Firstly, I have experienced increasing levels of physical pain over the past two years and there is question as to whether I have fibromyalgia. I have been reading through the mindfulness for health text, but would like additional guidance and support in my practice of the disciplines. 
Further to this, as a clinician I have an increased number of clients being referred with chronic health conditions and I would like to build my knowledge and skills to be able to assist them in coping more adaptively both with the physical pain that they are experiencing and the attached effect on their mood and functioning.

Due to that and many restrictions that ad to be provided to my life more than 10 years go I experoienced a lot of emotional pain and there was noone who could help at that time to cope with it. With time I discovered on my own that the acceptance and ability to be with what is is the key and that I may live my life fully still though the conditions are different and I had to give up many of my dreams. Or re-define them. This process still lasts. I found out that meditation helps my in accepting both external and internal conditions that are just a part of my life and sometimes cannot be changed.

First, I know Vidyamala and was supporting a Breathworks-Buddhism-Introduction-Retreat in August 2019 in Adhisthana, because I have been in the UK doing the Dharma-Life Course for five month. A few weeks ago I joined in the Breathworks Online Weekend Retreat led by Vidyamala and I was quite surprised how deep this went. Then, I see the Breathworks Mindfulness Training as part of my buddhist practice as I want to develop some fearlessness and see this as a good basis for any spiritual development in general. Also I would like to do the Breathworks-training in Germany next year, also because I see this Programm as a very good translation of the Dharma and that it's very helpful for human beings. Beside Vidyamala I also know a few Breathworks-Teachers and I thought, this specific kind of mindfulness-training for me is what has to be done and to work on. Also after almost two years out of professional work, I hope this course will help me dealing mindfully with new professional advantages that might come up as I hope soon to start my new old job again. Also, I was doing a therapy this year and I hope to bring my insights into my daily life with the help of mindfulness training. In addition, I think that for a long time in my life I had no good sense of my self and that I was kind of dependent on other people (what they want from me or I think they want from me, etc.). As I have started a daily meditation practice more than six years ago, this was very helpful for me coming back to myself and to my own experience. During the last couple of months I was also suffering from some body pain issues and I guess, that the mindfulness program is helpful with that.","Yes, I am able to practice mindfulness exercises/techniques for at least 20 minutes per day for the duration of the course",

 Cerebral palsy affects  my mobility which makes it harder for me to walk and stand so therefore I need to pace myself particularly when doing things like walking meditations. Sometimes I use a mobility scooter or a wheelchair. I also have dyspraxia. This affects the speed at which I can process written and verbal information. Sometimes I may take longer to read something or to write something down. One of the most helpful things for me is bullet pointed notes regarding things that might be key in the session. Note taking can be a little bit more challenging for me as it requires me to split my attention between listening and writing. Dyspraxia can cause some challenges with attention deficit. I may occasionally ask for questions to be rephrased or I may ask for information to be repeated.
